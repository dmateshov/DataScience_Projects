# Credit Card Approval

Banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit score. Manually analyzing these applications is expensive, error-prone, and time-consuming. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning and every commercial bank does so. In this project, I build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques.

The dataset in this project is the Credit Card Approval [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
